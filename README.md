# E7-Bookmark-Purchaser
Using Bluestacks as the host, purchases bookmarks and mystic medals from the secret shop (or any shop)

Note: 
- Actively uses mouse inputs, so may not function if you are using the mouse
- currently only works if the application is fullscreen. Hopefully will release an update that rescales the image based on size.
- Windows only

May be buggy, may get banned for using it. I for sure haven't gotten banned yet.
